This is a console based java application

This project uses a custom Red-Black Tree implementation to store and retrieve data about current NBA players.
This app has many functionalitiies:
Users can add new players to the database
Users can check who is the leader in any statistical category
Users can search current NBA players to view their stats
Data is stored in csv file, so it is not always up to date

This app is also capable of auto-complete, if you do not type in the full player name or cannot remember how to spell the name, the app will match what you have written to the closest NBA player name that you probably meant to type
For example, "leb" will bring up result for LeBron James or any other player with a similar name


To run this app, run make compile
